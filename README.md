# JavaScript Playground

## File Structure

1. Make a new directory for each simple problem.

2. Name the primary file for your code whatever you would like (`index.js` is nice and simple).

3. Create a test file in the directory (named `test.js`).

```js
describe('My JavaScript Problem', () => {
  it('should do a thing');
});
```
